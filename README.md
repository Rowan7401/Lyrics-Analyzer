# This is a random for fun project I did to analyze song lyrics
# If you input an artist name and song, the program can count the number of curse words in the song, return the top ten most used words of the song, and it has a search function where you can search for specific words in the lyrics
# The only problem is that with this type of web scraping, websites usually block your ip address unless you put in sleep times for the request. So, when searching for an artist with a lot of songs, this program will take a while to run
